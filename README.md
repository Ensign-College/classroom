# GitHub Classroom for Students: A Quick Guide

## 1\. Setting Up

-   Sign up for a GitHub account if you don't have one. This is essential for accessing any repositories on GitHub, including those on GitHub Classroom.
-   Ensure your instructor has your GitHub username. They'll need this to add you to classroom repositories.

## 2\. Accepting an Assignment

-   When your instructor creates an assignment, you'll receive a unique link (either through email or another communication tool like Slack, Canvas, etc.).
-   Click on the link. If it's your first time using GitHub Classroom, you may need to authorize the application to access your GitHub account.
-   Once authorized, you'll be led to a page where you can accept the assignment. This will create a repository for your assignment. Note: Each student generally gets their own personal repository.

## 3\. Cloning the Repository

-   On your assignment repository page, click the green `Code` button and copy the URL.
-   Open your terminal or command prompt. Navigate to the directory where you'd like to store the project using `cd your_directory_name`.
-   Type `git clone` and then paste the URL you copied. Press Enter. This will download your assignment repository to your computer.

## 4\. Working on the Assignment

-   Navigate to the cloned repository on your local machine and start working on your assignment.
-   Make frequent commits with descriptive messages to save your progress. Use `git add .` to stage your changes and `git commit -m "Your descriptive message here"` to commit them.

## 5\. Pushing Your Changes

-   Once you're ready to submit or share your work with the instructor, push your changes to the GitHub repository. Use `git push origin main` (or `git push origin master` depending on your default branch name).

## 6\. Submitting Your Assignment

-   If your instructor requires a formal submission process, go back to your repository on GitHub.
-   Click on the `Pull requests` tab.
-   Click `New Pull Request`, then `Create Pull Request`. Add any comments if needed, then submit. This will let your instructor know you've completed the assignment and it's ready for review.

## 7\. Receiving Feedback

-   After your instructor reviews your work, they might leave comments or feedback directly on the GitHub repository. Check the `Issues` tab or the `Pull requests` tab to see any feedback.

## 8\. Making Changes After Feedback

-   If you need to make changes after receiving feedback, simply make those changes in your local copy, then commit and push them as before.
-   If you made a pull request earlier, these changes will automatically update there.

### Tips:

-   Always pull the latest version of the repository before starting to work, especially if collaborating with others: `git pull origin main`.
-   If you run into merge conflicts or issues, GitHub has a lot of resources and guides to help. Don't hesitate to refer to them or ask your instructor for assistance.

Remember, the more you use Git and GitHub Classroom, the more comfortable you'll become with the platform. Happy coding!
